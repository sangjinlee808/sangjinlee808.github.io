## Experience on Javascript

So when I first started using Javascript, it was slighty confusing at first because of how lenient this langauge was. Another thing that I also experienced was how Javascript doesn't use int, String, float, and etc. but rather just uses let, const, and var. I have used Java in the past so I'm more familiar with that language but Javascript was pretty similar to Java so it didn't take me long to figure out what to do. While going thorugh the ES6 on [free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) website, there were many things that I wasn't aware of but it was interesting to go through all of them. 

For me Javascript is a good programming language since it is pretty simple to use. If I can understand how to use it from first experience, then I'm pretty sure that others would be able to do so as well.

## Practice WOD's

I find that the practice WOD's that the TA's provide us is extremely helpful. Being able to practice on WOD's constantly especially the ones that are similiar to the actuals ones help me understand better on what I should do. I get help from the TA's if I don't understand what I should do or if I couldn't finish the code. It may be stressful being unable to figure out what I should do but at the same time, it's also very pleasant feeling when I figure out and understand the code.
