## Views on Coding Standards
For me, following the coding standards does help improve my understand of the programming language. First of all, it is very easy to follow
through the code when I use coding standards. That way I can keep track on where I am and to see if any of the loops or any if-else
statements are finished or within the curly brackets. Currently I am also doing C/C++ programming (ICS 212) and one of the requirements
that I need to do is to following the code standards that they provided with examples. Now they don't have thoes automatic code format like
JSFiddle and IntelliJ so I have to do it manually. It may be painful but it helps a lot on understanding the code. Another thing about
coding standards is that it is prety much required thing to do so it's is better if you know how format the code properly. 

After using IntelliJ and ESLint for a while it wasn't as bad the first time. When I first started on it, it was confusing at first (well
mostly the setup part) but after using it from time to time, it became a bit more easier to understand. Trying to get the green check mark
can be fustrating since you would think that you did it correctly but the software says it's not. But at the same time, it is very
convenient since at least you know what you're doing wrong and can try to fix it.
