## How has the outbreak of Covid-19 changed my daily life?
To be honest, the only thing that I have noticed from the affects of Covid-19 is my sleeping schedule. Due to Covid-19 shutting down
college, I would tend sleep late at night (about 3-4am). I know there are online classes so what I would usually do is wake up at those
times when the professors start the online class then I would immediatly fall back alseep. Other than that, I would say nothing much has 
changed my daily life during this outbreak.

## Challenges relating to college
There were a couple of challenges that I had to face during the Covid-19 outbreak. One of them would be distraction. Before the outbreak,
I would tend to work on majority of my assignments in school so that I can concentrate better but since that's impossible now, I tend to
get distracted a lot. Another thing would be the online classes. There isn't much of a problem doing online things for ICS 314 (since most
of our works are online) but my ICS 212 is a bit hard for online class. It was more effective going to class physically for that class in
my opinion. Some others thing would be getting help from professors or TA's since it is pretty difficult to ask for help when you're
sending emails every hour trying to explain what the problem is.
