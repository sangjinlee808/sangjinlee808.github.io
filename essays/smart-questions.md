According to *Eric Steven Raymonds*, he mentions that the first step in asking smart quesiton is to find the right fourm for that topic. After that, when a person asks for question it should be revelant to their topics which should be in the field of coding and provides all the nescessary materials needed to solve the question which was posted. The question should also be 
grammatically correct so that it doesn't confuse others and should be organized. One example of can be found here [*unsuccesfully trying to add integers of an arry in function C++*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50867612/unsuccesfully-trying-to-add-integers-of-an-array-in-function-c), the person asking the question gives a clear details of what the output of the code is giving him/her, provides
the code itself so that others can take a look at it to figure out the problem, and also gives a clear goal of what he/she wants to get.
Due to this, the community that answered his/her question in a effect way where he/she was able to fix the code and can use this as a
future reference and other who also have a similar problem can look into this question can figure out their problem.

## What is a Bad Question?

Now a what makes a bad question is when a person: 
<blockquote 1. post your question to a forum where it's off topic
> 2. post a very elementary question to a forum where advanced technical questions are expected, or vice-versa
> 3. cross-post to too many different newsgroups
> 4. post a personal e-mail to somebody who is neither an acquaintance of yours nor personally responsible for solving your problem
