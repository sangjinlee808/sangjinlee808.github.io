## Why Should I Use Complicated UI Frameworks
Well first of all using frameworks that are a bit more complicated than others means that in the end, you will produce a better product
in terms of quailty. It will cost you a lot of time to work your way through and there will be times where you will feel frustrated because of some simple bug/error. But in the end, your end product will look much nicer and you will feel relieved and proud in the end. Not only that, more people would want to use or visit(website) your completed work because it looks organized and was done with care. When I first used Semantic UI to reproduce a website, it almost looked identical except for the fact that you couldn't really do anything on that website. 

## HTML Sucks Nowdays
First of all, HTML really just looks like those website in the late 1900s. There really is nothing that look good on a website produced from HTML. When I first used HTML and later looked at the final product, my first thought was "this looks like those websites that I visited back when I was like 7 or 8". There really is no spark with HTML where to be honest it looks plain. This is the reason why most software engineers or web developers would use something other than HTML (something that's more complicated than HTML) since the end product will be much better.
