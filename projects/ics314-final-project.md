summary: Final project that me and my teammates worked on during the Covid-19 pandemic.

For this project, my primary job was to create a join club method where the users can either join the clubs that they desire or leave the
club they wish to leave. There was also the "more info" button where when clicked, it will direct them to a page where it provides more 
information and functions about the club they are interested in. There were many errors that I can arcoss but due to the help my
teammates, I was able to learn and fix the problems that I had.

## Working During Covid-19
Due the worldwide spread of the disease of Covid-19, we had no choice but to work on our project at home. However, we did not have too much
complications while working from home since we were able to use discord to discuss our project layout and was able to provide necessary
information. The online meeting, Zoom, also sort of helped us with meeting with our professors and TA's for help.
