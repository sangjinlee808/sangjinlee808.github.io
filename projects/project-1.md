This was the first project that I was assigned to during my time at ICS 111 where I had to come up with a code for a Library where I can check-out books, check-in books, display the title and author of the books, add a book, add a patron, and many more. This project was gruesome where it took me hours upon hours each day trying to figure out how do encoporate a bunch of codes to get the result that I wanted. Since it was a individual project and not a group project, there were many problems that I can across. I had to look online majority of the methods that I should use in order to fix the problems that I encountered while coding. While it took me manys hours trying to produce a significant result, it was also enjoyable since I got to learn many things.

There were manys things that I learned while doing this project and also taking ICS classes as well. First one would be learning the languages of programming, especially Java. Also, I learned to be a bit more patient as well and by that I mean that it takes alot of time and effort if you want to code. It was very frustrating at first when I started the project but gradually over time, I had to be a little more patient, think about it more, and to maybe take a breather once in a while. Lastly, I learned to think like a computer science. For example, when I get stuck on a line of code I would think about how to fix it by going over one line at a time. I would think of ways on how to fix the problem when I'm outside or when I'm about to go to sleep.
