summary: The time where I was in a basketball team for the district.

<img class="ui image" src="/images/saltlake.png">

During my middle school and high school days, I have always enjoyed playing basketball with my friends. Eventually I would end up playing in the district with my friends and others whom I never met before. At first I wasn't very good at basketball but with the practice that the coach gives and also by playing with others ouside of my practice hours I became much more efficient than before. 

While playing for the team, I also gained various of skills where one of them would be communication. In order for us to play as a team, we must be able to communicate with each other so that we could pass to a teammate who as free or do let the one with the ball know that I am there to assist him. Teamwork is also very important aspect to basketball since you cannot win unless you work as a team. So, during those days, I have learn to work as a team and to communicate with others so that we can defeat other teams.

## How does these skills help me later on?

Well first of all these skills are important to me not just from the basketball perspective but also in any type of fields, like computer science. Putting many hours and effort on coding practice can help me gain more knowledge how coding and help me understand what I'm doing. Communication and teamwork in this field is also important where with teamwork, we can help one another and to efficiently take a step foward towards our goal.
